Content Scramble System â€“ A Study

The playback of a video DVD is obstructed by the Content Scramble System (CSS). The details of CSS are only given to licensees for a fee. The license itself is bound to a non-disclosure agreement. Thus, based on a CSS license, it wouldn't be possible to develop an open-source software player. However, open-source is a vital requirement for trusted software.

Luckily there were people who addressed this issue. People who re-engineered software, published the mechanism, analyzed the algorithms and revealed their weaknesses. In the end there were the developers of libdvdcss who put all this together and made their software available on many computer platforms.

Despite the success of libdvdcss, the CSS documentation remained rather poor. This project is intended to close the gap. It provides a detailed description of the CSS mechanism. If public sources are available they are cited. In fact the source-code of libdvdcss is invaluable. There are also secondary sources which may help understand CSS. 

Alongside, this project is accompanied with a piece of software that is used to run some tests to verify CSS details.
